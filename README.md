## Abstract
_Context_: Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems beyond classical capabilities. However, its current state faces limitations due to noise, hardware instability, and high energy requirements. Among these, the selection of the number of shots, often arbitrary, remains an open concern that has a direct impact on the accuracy of the results.
_Objective_: This study aims to determine whether a tailored optimisation of the number of shots for quantum circuits can improve the success probability of the obtained results on real quantum computers.
_Method_: We propose an estimation algorithm that calculates the optimal number of shots required to meet a predefined error threshold. The algorithm was tested on several circuits, including Groverâ€™s algorithm and Greenoble (an optimised version of Grover & Rudolph). Each circuit was executed with multiple shot configurations: the IBM default, intermediate values, our estimated value, and higher configurations.
_Results_: The results show that the estimated number of shots consistently provides the highest accuracy of the results.
_Conclusions_: This estimation algorithm provides a practical reference for selecting the number of shots, avoiding unnecessary repetitions and promoting more resource-efficient quantum executions. It represents a step towards sustainable optimization in quantum software development.
